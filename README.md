Android App
Our Second Project is Android app the name of our app is Barcode Scanner  ,to make this app we have use the firebase ML kit which contains the pre-trained libraries and dependencies based on Machine learning  which detects the barcode from the image and display the data present in the barcode .So as soon as the app is installed in any device first it asks for the camera and storage permission , then in the app interface there is a button names Scan Barcode which gives you two options first is to take photo using camera and other one is Gallery to choose photo from the gallery . But there is one Problem, to scan the barcode and display the result there is a requirement of one cloud based library and to use that library there is pricing for that which is in US dollars which we are not able to afford . But except that one library our project is fully working .
